___
### There are three problems:

1. Write the following function’s body. A nested dictionary is passed as parameter. You need to
print all keys with their depth.

2. Write a new function with same functionality from Question 1, but it should be able to handle
a Python object in addition to a dictionary from Question 1.

3. Write following functions body. 2 Nodes are passed as parameter. You need to find Least
Common Ancestor and print its value.

## Problem three (3) Runtime and Memory requirements:
**_Problem 3 is a binary tree problem. Find the Lowest Common Ancestor in Binary Tree_**

### Runtime Complexity: ```O(n)```.
The above solution’s time complexity is ```O(n)``` as the method does a simple tree traversal in a bottom-up fashion. 

### Memory Complexity: ```O(n)```.
